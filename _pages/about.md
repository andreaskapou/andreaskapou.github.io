I am post doctoral cross disciplinary fellow ([XDF](https://www.ed.ac.uk/cross-disciplinary-fellowships)) at the University of Edinburgh working in machine learning and statistical modelling of single cell genomics. My aim is to purse cross-disciplinary research in the intersection of data science and biomedicine.

I am working with [Catalina Vallejos](https://vallejosgroup.github.io/) and collaborate closely with [Neil Henderson's](https://www.ed.ac.uk/inflammation-research/people/principal-investigators/professor-neil-henderson) lab where we use multi-modal single cell technologies to decode the molecular mechanisms regulating liver fibrosis and regeneration. I did my `PhD` at the School of Informatics (University of Edinburgh) under the supervision of [Guido Sanguinetti](https://datascience.sissa.it/person/11/guido-sanguinetti).
